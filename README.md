This is a ticket tracker app which helps keep track of how many tickets each employee has. The main contents of the app are the name, role and ticket count for each employee.

This was built using react using scss to style.

I encountered some issues when trying to split the objects onto separate cards however this was over come with the use of props and creating a new 'Card' component. 

The overall aesthetic of the app is a high point with a few small changes to be implemented such as the appearance of the plus and minus buttons.

There are also a few limitations with my app, when you click the minus button when the number is on 0 it removes the number and it cannot be brought back by clicking the pluss button. I believe this has something to do with the storage of numbers in an array.
